### About me


I am now a postdoctoral researcher at Ecole de Technologie Supérieure, in the Laboratoire d'Innovation Ouverte en Technologies de la Santé, Montréal, Québec, Canada. I work on the use of markerless motion capture and machine learning to improve fall risk prediction for healthy elderly adults. This one-year postdoc is a continuation of a first postdoc carried out with the LAMIH in Université Polytechnique Hauts-de-France, France. I am curious about biomechanics in general and motion analysis in particular, with a strong interest in the methods used for motion analysis.

**Education 👩‍🎓**

- PhD student in biomechanics and motion analysis, Université Gustave Eiffel, Lyon, France. Finished in 2024!
- M. Sc in biomechanics, Arts et Métiers Paristech, Paris, France.
- M. Sc in engineering, Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.

**Research interest**

I have a strong interest in movement analysis. While the focus of my PhD was on video-based markerless motion capture methods, I am also curious about the clinical questions associated with movement.
